          <div class="event-description">
            Blind coding is the ultimate test of a programmer's skill, where logic, speed, and precision are pushed to the limits. Without the ability to see or debug in real time, coders rely purely on their understanding of syntax and problem-solving prowess. It's a thrilling challenge that not only sharpens coding expertise but also builds confidence in thinking algorithmically under pressure. For those seeking to master their craft and truly elevate their abilities, blind coding is an exhilarating exercise that separates the great from the best. Ready to code without a safety net?

            you write a simple program with the only catch being that you are
            blind-folded? If you think you have what it takes to solve this
            puzzle then you are welcome here! Come and be a part of this event
